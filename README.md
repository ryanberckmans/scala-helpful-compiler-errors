## Scala helpful compiler errors

A list of Scala compiler errors that could be more helpful, especially for newcomers to Scala.

The list is focused on Scala 3's Dotty compiler. One day this list could be useful for a [larger project](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/towards-better-error-messages-in-scalac/1470/31) around compiler errors. Such a project seems unlikely to occur for Scala 2.13's scalac, which is why this list is Dotty-specific.

## Pull requests welcome
